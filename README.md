# LSTM for assistance level prediction
train LSTM with stroke therapist and patient data

We collected some sample data in file trial2.csv to train the network.

Feel free to change the hyperparameters in config_1.json. Recommand to directly use config_2.json.

We only use point by point prediction method here.

Architecture of LSTM model (the number of inputs given to the model could change depending on how many inputs we want to use to train the model):
